'WanderJaunt: A Traveller's Dream'

## Overview

This project was a quick app prototype that I made as part of an Interview for an AirBnb-like company called WanderJaunt. The Whole thing was coded up in ~10 hours, purely as a demonstration of both what I could do, my sense for UI/UX design, and also as an example of just how powerful Flutter is as a development framework.
